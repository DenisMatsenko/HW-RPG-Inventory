## ⚪️ Task
### Practical part
Create an application that will capture inventory from an RPG game. 
It will be possible to put different types of items in the inventory that have different properties. 
E.g. food spoils over time, weapons wear out from combat, etc.
The inventory will be able to traverse its contents without directly 
accessing the internal collection in which the items will be stored.
Also create a service application in which it will be
possible to verify the operation of the assignment.

### Written part
In the written part, analyze the principles and possibilities of inheritance, implementation of interfaces, method override and genericity.

## ⚪️ Execution of the practical part


## ⚪️ Execution of the written part
### Class inheritance

<b>Princip</b><br/>
  - The principle of class inheritance - a data type can inherit at the same
time extend or change the characteristics (data and functionality) of some
existing type.

<b>Are used</b><br/>
  - Class inheritance used to minimize code by using already existing code and
structuring software components for easier orientation in the program code.


### Interfaces
<b>Princip</b><br/>
  - The princip of interfaces - a type that can define functionality (methods 
and properties) without an implementation, to apply and implement it in multiple
classes and structures. Also, classes and structures have the ability to inherit
an unlimited number of interfaces (unlike class inheritance).

<b>Are used</b><br/>
  - Interface are used for simplified creation of classes and structures with an
extensive functionality, structuring of software components for easier orientation
in the program code.

### Method override

<b>Princip</b><br/>
  - The princip of override method - override method provides a new implementation of the method inherited from a base class.

<b>Are used</b><br/>
  - Override method - allowing a derived class to provide a specific implementation of a method already implemented in base class.


### Generic class
<b>Princip</b><br/>
  - The princip of generic class - a class capable of performing the same functionality for different data types.

<b>Are used</b><br/>
  - Generic clsses are used in most cases when it is necessary to create a collection that is flexible to the type of the contained data.
